# Sohjoa fleet-management simulation

This application was developed for the [Sohjoa]( http://sohjoa.fi/) project aimed to facilitate new know-how, business and job-opportunities in Finland associated with autonomous vehicles. The application serves as a platform to experiment the capabilities of autonomous vehicles in public transportation situations with specific aim to uncover requirements for a functional fleet-management system of autonomous vehicles (such as the architecture of the application and the communication required between the buses and the fleet-management system).

### Usage

The application operates via REST-endpoints and should be used with a [client application]( https://github.com/Crusadix/Fleet-management-client). Follow the link for additional information for using the platform with a client application. The client is also live [here](http://users.metropolia.fi/~hermannq/Sohjoa/Fleet_management/home.html) currently running on Heroku and Metropolia private cloud (running on free dynos, may take a few minutes to start up!).
